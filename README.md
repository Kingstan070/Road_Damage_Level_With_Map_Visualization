# 🚧 Road Damage Level with Map Visualization 🚧

This project aims to develop an advanced road condition monitoring system leveraging dashcam video footage and integrated GPS data. The system is designed to provide comprehensive insights into road quality and enhance resource allocation for road maintenance. By analyzing dashcam videos, the system will automatically detect and classify various road conditions, including potholes and cracks.

## 🌟 Features

- **🎥 Video Frame Preprocessing:** Efficient extraction and preprocessing of frames from dashcam videos.
- **🔍 Semantic Segmentation:** Applying state-of-the-art models to identify and segment road features.
- **🕳️ Pothole Detection:** Specialized algorithms for accurate detection and classification of potholes.
- **🌐 GPS Integration:** Synchronizing detected road conditions with GPS coordinates.
- **🗺️ Heatmap Visualization:** Generating interactive heat maps to visualize road conditions across different regions.
- **📊 Time Series Analysis:** Tracking changes in road conditions over time for proactive maintenance.
- **📄 Detailed Reports:** Comprehensive reports on road quality trends and insights for better resource management.
